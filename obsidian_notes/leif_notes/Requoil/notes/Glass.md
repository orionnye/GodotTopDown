 Glass is mysterious mineral with many unusual properties. It is the primary export of **KRALL-SHARD**. The glass industry is extremely lucrative despite the very high mortality rate.

Glass has a number of miraculous properties that make it incredibly valuable: 

First is energy absorbance; glass can absorb energy over time into itself, if given too much energy at once may fracture or even explode. Glass while able to store quite a bit of energy is not limitless and will fracture or explode if overcharged.

Second is energy dispersal; glass will release energy in a consistent way; by shaping the internal structure of glass the output and interval of energy release can be altered.

thirdly is biomimicry; high quality glass can be implanted into biological organisms via surgery. If successful the glass will begin mimicking biological pathways. Typically it is used to mimic nerve or braincell pathways. Even when the host dies (or has the glass surgically removed) the glass will continue its mimicry of the biological pathways. The glass is typically 'set' at this point to reduce the chance of further mimicry. It is then implanted into clients.

Tl:dr glass can be put into one person (like a martial arts master) to 'learn' their skills and then be implanted into another person so that they can get those skills without having to learn them.
