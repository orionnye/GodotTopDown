Guns are the primary way player deals damage to hostile mobs.

Guns (like [melee weapons](obsidian://open?vault=Requoil&file=Melee%20weapons)) do bonus damage at higher velocities. Building speed is one of the easiest ways to increase damage.

Currently implemented guns are:

Twin barrel shotgun

Pistol

Rocket launcher

Rifle

Assault rifle
